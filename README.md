# Statusbot

Statusbot is a Slackbot for Buildkite's Private and Public slack that helps interface customers with our monitoring services and site status information.

## Incident Updates

We use https://www.buildkitestatus.com/ to report on infrastructure incidents. Statusbot posts slack messages when an incident is created and then posts updates as they occur.
